## üöÄ Projects
- **[Object Detection using Lidar Data](https://github.com/shikha6926/Automated-Parallel-Parking)**:
  - Leveraged LiDAR sensor data to accurately detect and classify objects in a 3D environment. The project involved:
  - **Point Cloud Processing:** Processed raw point cloud data using the PCL (Point Cloud Library) to identify and classify objects.
  - **Custom Algorithms:**
    - Developed a **Segmentation Algorithm** using RANSAC to extract and isolate planar surfaces.
    - Implemented a **KD-Tree-based Clustering Algorithm** from scratch to group and identify objects in 3D space.
  - This work was built on top of a forked repository from the **Udacity Sensor Fusion course**
    
- **[Time-Optimal Automated Parking](https://github.com/shikha6926/Automated-Parallel-Parking)**:
    Designed and implemented algorithms for precision parallel parking in minimal time. Key aspects include:
  - **Control Algorithms:** Developed robust trajectory planning and control methods for maneuvering in tight spaces.  
  - **Optimization:** Focused on minimizing the time required for parking while ensuring safety and precision.

- **[Miniature Autonomous Race Car Controller](https://github.com/shikha6926/Race_Car_MPCC_Controller)**:
  - **Model Predictive Control (MPC):** Implemented a non-linear MPC framework to optimize lap time while maintaining stability.  
  - **Trajectory Planning:**    
    - **Spline-Based Formulation:** Enhanced the trajectory by converting the center line into a smooth spline-based representation. This allowed for a more   continuous path, leading to improved control and reduced lap times.  
  - **Modified MPCC Controller:** Updated the MPCC controller to incorporate the spline-based formulation, optimizing vehicle dynamics for maximum speed while adhering to track constraints.

- **[3D Mapping using RGB-D SLAM](https://github.com/shikha6926/RGBD-SLAM-FreiCAR-LAB)**: Created detailed maps with Graph SLAM techniques.  
    This project implements a graph-based SLAM pipeline to create detailed 3D maps using RGB-D data.

  - **Multi-Sensor Integration:** Combines data from the **Stereolabs ZED2 RGB-D camera** for point cloud creation, **Intel Realsense T265** for pose estimation, and a **VIVE tracker** for ground truth evaluation.
  - **Graph Optimization:** Uses **g2o** for graph optimization to refine pose estimates and correct drift, ensuring accurate map generation.
  - **Loop Closure Detection:** Identifies revisited locations to improve map consistency and reduce errors in large-scale environments.
  - **Key Technologies:** Uses **ROS**, **g2o**, **OpenCV**, **PCL**, **Stereolabs ZED2**, **Intel Realsense T265**, and **VIVE Tracker** for efficient 3D mapping and localization.
